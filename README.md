Latest stable release: ![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-19.02.2-blue)

*oneclient* is a command line [Onedata](onedata.org) client. It provides a POSIX interface to user's files in *Onedata* system.

# User Guide

## Building

### Dependencies

An up-to-date list of *oneclient* build dependencies for Ubuntu and Fedora is available in [control](pkg_config/debian/control) and [oneclient.spec](pkg_config/oneclient.spec) files respectively. For building on Ubuntu Bionic, detailed dependecy list can be found in [Travis configuration](.travis.yml).

### Compilation

```bash
export ONEDATA_GIT_URL=https://github.com/onedata
git clone https://github.com/onedata/oneclient.git && cd oneclient

# Initialize submodules
make submodules

# To build debug version
mkdir debug && cd debug
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCODE_COVERAGE=ON -DWITH_CEPH=ON -DWITH_SWIFT=ON -DWITH_S3=ON -DWITH_GLUSTERFS=ON -DWITH_WEBDAV=ON -DWITH_ONEDATAFS=ON ..
cd ..
cmake --build release
```

*oneclient* by default compiles with built-in support for Ceph, S3, OpenStack SWIFT, GlusterFS and WebDAV.  These drivers can be disabled during compilation by providing the following flags:

* WITH_CEPH=OFF - disables Ceph support
* WITH_S3=OFF - disables S3 support
* WITH_SWIFT=OFF - disables Swift support
* WITH_GLUSTERFS=OFF - disables GlusterFS support
* WITH_WEBDAV=OFF - disables WebDAV support

The compiled binary `oneclient` will be created on path `release/oneclient`.

## Installation

### Linux
Oneclient is supported on several major Linux platforms including Ubuntu and CentoOS. To install *oneclient* using packages simply use the following command:

```bash
curl -sS  http://get.onedata.org/oneclient.sh | bash
```

> Oneclient is packaged into self-contained packages, i.e. it has to be installed into it's default prefix `/opt/oneclient`. The provided packages will do that by default and create symlinks in the `/usr` prefix to the `oneclient` binary as well as man pages, configuration file and auto-completion scripts.

## Usage

`oneclient` can be called directly from command line to mount Onedata virtual filesystem on the machine. For most cases basic usage should be sufficient:

```
oneclient -t <ACCESS_TOKEN> -H <PROVIDER_IP> <MOUNT_PATH>
```

When connecting to a Oneprovider instance without a valid trusted SSL certificate, `-i` option must be added.

### Mounting selected spaces
`oneclient` will present under the specified mountpoint all spaces available to the user whose access token was passed on the command line.

It is however possible to limit the spaces which are visible, by providing a white list of the spaces on the command line. This can be achieved using 2 options:

  * `--space <name>` -  every occurence of this option followed by the name of a space will limit the mounted spaces to the specified spaces (e.g. `--space Space1 --space Space2`)
  * `--space-id <id>` -  every occurence of this option followed by the id of a space will limit the mounted spaces to the specified spaces (e.g. `--space-id a58a461875b59988bd16eca960d8130b --space-id bd16eca960d8130ba58a461875b53451`)

### Direct IO and Proxy IO modes
By default `oneclient` will automatically try to detect if it can access storage supporting mounted spaces directly, which significantly improves IO performance as all read and write operations go directly to the storage and not via the Oneprovider service.

This feature can be controlled using 2 command line options:

  * `--force-proxy-io` - disables Direct IO mode, all data transfers will go via Oneprovider service
  * `--force-direct-io` - forces Direct IO mode, if it is not available for any of mounted spaces, `oneclient` will fail to mount

> In direct io mode, Oneclient will attempt to access the target storage directly on first attempt to read/write a file. This means that very often the first operation will fail with warning `Resource temporarily unavailable`. However if the storage access is detected, the  consecutive operations should work as expected.

### Buffering
`oneclient` employs an in-memory buffer for input and output data blocks, which can significantly improve performance for various types of storages, in particular object based storages such as S3.

If for some reason this local cache is undesired, it can be disabled using `--no-buffer` option.

### Force full block read mode

By default, POSIX `read` request can return less bytes than requested, especially on network filesystem which can return partial data range which is immediately available and request the remaining bytes assuming the application will run another `read` request with adjusted offset and size. However, some applications assume that the read always return the requested range or error. In order to enable this behavior in `oneclient` it necessary to provide the `--force-fullblock-read` on the command line.

### Overriding storage helper parameters

Oneclient allows to override certain storage helper parameters in order to customize direct access to storage from a Oneclient host to the storage. Use cases for this feature include specifying custom mounpoint for POSIX storages, alternate IP addresses for network storages (e.g. available over local network from Oneclient host), etc.

For example, to tell Oneclient that storage with a NFS storage is mounted at `/home/user1/nfs` the following option should be added to the Oneclient command line: `--override 2bede2623303bc2a19696e5817e13c0b:mountPoint:/home/user/nfs`. `2bede2623303bc2a19696e5817e13c0b` is the storage Id of this storage.

The `--override` option takes 3 arguments separated by `:`:
* storade ID - this is Onedata internal storage Id, which can be obtained from Onepanel administrator interface or using REST API
* parameter name - this is the name of the storage helper parameter, these are specific to particular type of storage
* parameter value - a value which should override the value specified in the Oneprovider when registering the storage

### Logging

In order to enable a verbose log, *oneclient* provides a `-v` flag which takes a single integer argument which determines the log verbosity:

- `-v 0` - *(default)* only serious errors
- `-v 1` - warnings and errors which are not fatal
- `-v 2` - verbose information on requests and their handling
- `-v 3` - trace function calls along with their arguments
- `-v 4` - binary messages between Oneclient and Oneprovider

> Please note that above level 2, the size of the logs can be substantial thus it is necessary to monitor free disk space.

                                        to each locally modified file.
  -r [ --override ] <storageId>:<name>:<value>
                                        Allows to override selected helper 
                                        parameters for specific storage, e.g. 
                                        'd40f2f63433da7c845886f6fe970048b:mount
                                        Point:/mnt/nfs'
  --emulate-available-space <bytes> (=0)
                                        When set to non-zero value, emulates 
                                        available space reported by stat system
                                        call to specified number of bytes.

FUSE options:
  -f [ --foreground ]         Foreground operation.
  -d [ --debug ]              Enable debug mode (implies -f).
  -s [ --single-thread ]      Single-threaded operation.
  -o [ --opt ] <mount_option> Pass mount arguments directly to FUSE.

Monitoring options:
  --monitoring-type <reporter>        Enables performance metrics monitoring - 
                                      allowed values are: graphite.
  --monitoring-level-basic            Sets monitoring reporting level to basic 
                                      - default.
  --monitoring-level-full             Sets monitoring reporting level to full.
  --monitoring-period <seconds> (=30) Performance metrics reporting period.
  --graphite-url <url>                Graphite url - required when 
                                      monitoring-type is 'graphite', the scheme
                                      can be either tcp or udp and default port
                                      is 2003
  --graphite-namespace-prefix <name>  Graphite namespace prefix.
```

### Configuration

Besides commandline configuration options, oneclient reads options from a global configuration file located at `/usr/local/etc/oneclient.conf` (`/etc/oneclient.conf` when installed from the package). Refer to the [example configuration file](config/oneclient.conf) for details on the options.

#### Environment variables

Some options in the config file can be overridden using environment variables, whose names are capitalized version of the config options. For the up-to-date list of supported environment variables please refer to *oneclient* [manpage](man/oneclient.1).

## Running `oneclient` docker image

Running dockerized *oneclient* is easy:

```
docker run -it --privileged onedata/oneclient:19.02.2
```

To run *oneclient* image without it automatically mounting the volume specify custom entrypoint:

```
docker run -it --privileged --entrypoint bash onedata/oneclient:19.02.2
```


### Persisting the token

The application will ask for a token and run in the foreground. In order for *oneclient* to remember your token, mount volume `/root/.local/share/oneclient`:

```
docker run -it --privileged -v ~/.oneclient_local:/root/.local/share/oneclient onedata/oneclient:19.02.2
```

You can also pass your token in `ONECLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable:

```
docker run -it --privileged -e ONECLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN=$TOKEN onedata/oneclient:19.02.2
```

If *oneclient* knows the token (either by reading its config file or by reading the environment variable), it can be run as a daemon container:

```
docker run -d --privileged -e ONECLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN=$TOKEN onedata/oneclient:19.02.2
```

### Accessing your data

*oneclient* exposes NFS and SMB services for easy outside access to your mounted
spaces.

```
docker run -d --privileged -e ONECLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN=$TOKEN onedata/oneclient:19.02.2

# Display container's IP address
docker inspect --format "{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}" $(docker ps -ql)
```

Now you can mount using *NFS* or *Samba* with:

```
nfs://<CONTAINER_IP_ADDR>/mnt/oneclient
smb://<CONTAINER_IP_ADDR>/onedata
```
